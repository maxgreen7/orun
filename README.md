# Orun

Orun is a Python modular business framework, to simplify the ERP/CRM RIA development,
this is a RAD tool that delivers really professionals products in less time.
This is a Django derivative project, using Flask as webserver and inspired on OpenERP/Odoo (a collection of good ideas).

The ORM is built on top of sqlalchemy, although follows Django ORM patterns.

Orun should work with all sqlalchemy compatible database, however, the project goal
is add support for advanced database features, like schemas and other enterprise database resource.

Orun could be even used to build API and WebServices.

Highlights:
* Modularity and Module inheritance
* ORM Layer (with model inheritance support)
* Ajax or WebSocket Communication
* Incremental Migrations
* Row level based permission control
* Direct SqlAlchemy and Raw Sql


So far, tested on following databases:
* MSSQL - using PyODBC
* Postgresql - using Psycopg2
* Sqlite3 - _no schema support_
* MySql - _no schema support_
* Oracle 12c - cx_Oracle _no schema support_

_MongoDB soon..._
